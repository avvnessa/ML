One approach to address this issue is to initially increase the mutation rate, although this can have its own drawbacks as mentioned earlier. Alternatively, a function can be defined to identify local maximums, such as by detecting repeated values, and in such cases, the mutation rate can be increased. Another solution involves increasing the population size or the number of iterations the algorithm runs. Modifying the fitness function or changing the method for selecting individuals in the mating pool are additional strategies. Overall, since the algorithm's nature involves randomness, it is possible to encounter this problem regardless of the chosen method, but running the algorithm multiple times can sometimes be helpful."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1ZItwYf-2tVzK_8sWXUtPaPKSstdlFSel","timestamp":1708392779961}],"gpuType":"T4"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
